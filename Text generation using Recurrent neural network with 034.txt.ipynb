      "good enough for him.  mistress, if you give us no better food,\n",

      "and put his tongue out at the mistress.  she took up the thimble,\n",

      "the little tailor journeyed on and came to a great forest, and\n",

      "they thought, a little fellow like that can creep through a\n",
      "key-hole and serve as picklock to us.  hi, there, cried one of\n",
      "them, you giant goliath, will you go to the treasure-chamber\n",
      "with us.  you can slip yourself in and throw out the money.\n",
      "thumbling reflected a while, and at length he said, yes, and went\n",

      "above and below, to see if there was any crack in them.  it was\n",
      "not long before he espied one which was broad enough to let\n",
      "him in.  he was therefore about to get in at once, but one\n",
      "of the two sentries who stood before the door, observed him, and\n",
      "said to the other, what an ugly spider is creeping there, i\n",
      "will kill it.  let the poor creature alone, said the other,\n",
      "it has done you no harm.  then thumbling got safely through the\n",
      "crevice into the treasure-chamber, opened the window beneath\n",
      "which the robbers were standing, and threw out to them one\n",
      "taler after another.  when the little tailor was in the full\n",
      "swing of his work, he heard the king coming to inspect his\n",
      "treasure-chamber, and crept hastily into a hiding-place.  the king\n",
      "noticed that several solid talers were missing, but could not\n",
      "conceive who could have stolen them, for locks and bolts were\n",
      "in good condition, and all\n",
      "seemed well guarded.  then he went away again, and said to the\n",
      "sentries, be on the watch, someone is after the money.  when\n",
      "therefore thumbling recommenced his labors, they heard the money\n",
      "moving, and a sound of klink, klink, klink.  they ran swiftly\n",
      "in to seize the thief, but the little tailor, who heard them\n",
      "coming, was still swifter, and leapt into a corner and covered\n",
      "himself with a taler, so that nothing could be seen of him, and\n",
      "at the same time he mocked the sentries and cried, here am i.\n",
      "the sentries ran thither, but as they got there, he had\n",
      "already hopped into another corner under a taler, and was\n",
      "crying, ho, ho, here am i.  and thus he made fools of them,\n",
      "and drove them so long round about the treasure-chamber that\n",
      "they were weary and went away.  then by degrees he threw all the\n",
      "talers out, dispatching the last with all his might, then hopped\n",
      "nimbly upon it, and flew down with it through the window.  the\n",
      "robbers paid him great compliments.  you are a valiant hero,\n",
      "said they, will you be our captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "thumbling, however, declined, and said he wanted to see the\n",
      "world first.  they now divided the booty, but the little tailor\n",
      "only asked for a kreuzer because he could not carry more.\n",
      "then he once more buckled on his sword, bade the robbers goodbye,\n",
      "and took to the road.  first, he went to work with some masters,\n",
      "but he had no liking for that, and at last he hired himself\n",
      "as manservant in an inn.  the maids, however, could not endure\n",
      "him, for he saw all they did secretly, without their\n",
      "seeing him, and he told their employers what they had taken off\n",
      "the plates, and carried away out of the cellar, for themselves.\n",
      "then said they, wait, and we will pay you out, and arranged with\n",
      "each other to play him a trick.  soon afterwards when one of the\n",
      "maids was mowing in the garden, and saw thumbling jumping about\n",
      "and creeping up and down the plants, she mowed him up quickly with\n",
      "the grass, tied all in a great cloth, and secretly threw it to\n",
      "the cows.  now amongst them there was a great black one, who\n",
      "swallowed him down without hurting him.  down below, however, it\n",
      "did not suit him, for it\n",
      "was quite dark, neither was any candle burning.  when the cow\n",
      "was being milked he cried,\n",
      "          strip, strap, strull,\n",
      "          when will the pail be full.\n",
      "\n",
      "but the noise of the milking prevented his being understood.\n",
      "after this the master of the house came into the stall and\n",
      "said, that cow shall be killed to-morrow.  then thumbling was so\n",
      "alarmed that he cried out in a clear voice, let me out first,\n",
      "i am sitting inside her.  the master heard that quite well,\n",
      "but did not know from whence the voice came.  where are you, asked\n",
      "he.  in the black one, answered thumbling, but the master\n",
      "did not understand what that meant, and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "next morning the cow was killed.  happily thumbling did not meet\n",
      "with one blow at the cutting up and chopping, he got among\n",
      "the sausage-meat.  and when the butcher came in and began his\n",
      "work, he cried out with all his might, don't chop too deep,\n",
      "don't chop too deep, i am amongst it.  no one heard this because\n",
      "of the noise of the chopping-knife.  now poor thumbling was in\n",
      "trouble, but trouble sharpens the wits, and he sprang out so\n",
      "adroitly between the blows that none of them touched him, and\n",
      "he escaped with a whole skin.  but still he could not get away,\n",
      "there was nothing for it but to let himself be thrust into a\n",
      "black-pudding with the bits of bacon.  his quarters there were\n",
      "rather confined, and besides that he was hung up in the chimney\n",
      "to be smoked, and there time did hang terribly heavy on his hands.\n",
      "at length in winter he was taken down again, as the black-pudding\n",
      "had to be set before a guest.  when the hostess was cutting\n",
      "it in slices, he took care not to stretch out his head too\n",
      "far lest a bit of it should be cut off, at last he saw his\n",
      "opportunity, cleared a passage for himself, and jumped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "the little tailor, however, would not stay any longer in a house\n",
      "where he fared so ill, so at once set out on his journey again.\n",
      "but his liberty did not last long.  in the open country he met\n",
      "with a fox who snapped him up without thinking.  hi, there,\n",
      "mr. fox, cried\n",
      "the little tailor, it is i who am sticking in your throat, set\n",
      "me at liberty again.  you are right, answered the fox.  you\n",
      "are next to nothing for me, but if you will promise me the\n",
      "fowls in your father's yard i will let you go.  with all my\n",
      "heart, replied thumbling.  you shall have all the cocks and hens,\n",
