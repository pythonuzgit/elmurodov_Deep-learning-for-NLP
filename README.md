# Deep learning for Natural language processing.

Deep learning models have pressented very good performance on complex tasks that require deep understanding of text like translation question answering, summarization, natural language inference..

Natural language processing (NLP) deals with building computational algorithms to automitically analyze and represent human language.

Deep learning is a part of Machine learning or rather to say deep learning uses a particular algorithm of machine learning called “Neural Network”.
